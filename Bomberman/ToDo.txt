Merge explosion graphics (new explosions should not overlap existing ones).
Float animation speed
Improve player move (should be able to go between two obstacles when close to the opening)

Game constants
  The game constants (player life, max speed, bomb timer, etc.) should be stored in a configuration file and loaded when the game launches.

AssetManger
  The AssetManager is ugly right now. This is normal as it was not a priority.
  The Assets should be stored in some kind of collection, indexed by keys associated to the assets,
  and loaded using a metadata file storing the assets information (position and size in the sprite sheet).

Draw order
  We need a nice way to order the draw calls.
  Having a z index based on game object type fixes some problems but no all of them.
  For example, player 2 will always appear in front of player 1.

-- Thoughts --

Should the game keep collections of certain types of object in addition to the 'everything' collection ?
This would reduce the amount of processing done in some places (pick items, collisions, etc.),
but will increase the complexity of how we store the objects and may introduce inconsistencies if objects are shared between collections.
